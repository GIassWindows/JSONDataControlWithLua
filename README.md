# Data control with JSON file and Lua

Nothing much to show here, just dabbling with Lua and JSON in my free time. 

Showcasing how to read and insert data into JSON files.

# Note

I'm sure there's a module/library somewhere that allows this, but I felt like making my own just to understand it better.

Module made by GlassWindows (me).
