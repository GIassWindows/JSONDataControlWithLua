# Data control with JSON file and Lua

Nothing much to show here, just dabbling with Lua and JSON in my free time. 

Showcasing how to read and insert data into JSON files.

# How to use module

1. Create a local variable which contains the file path to a JSON file.

2. Place the module in the same folder as your main code.

3. Have fun.

# Functions

### returnJson(args: JsonFilePath)

Returns a table with the JSON data.

### insertDataIntoJson(args: JsonFilePath, arrayData)

Inserts array/dictionary into the JSON file.

# Note

I'm sure there's a module/library somewhere that allows this, but I felt like making my own just to understand it better.

Module made by GlassWindows (me).
